LevelDecomposer
===============

**Description**

This is a package of 2 tools that:

- decomposes a level bitmap to a tile sheet and level data

- recomposes a level bitmap from a tile sheet and level data

**Example**

TODO

**Notes**

- debug builds have command line arguments for testing against 'test\level.png' file

- whenever 'LevelDecomposer' is built the 'test' folder gets cleaned

- both command-line utilities are self-contained thanks to Fody, i.e. you only need the EXE
